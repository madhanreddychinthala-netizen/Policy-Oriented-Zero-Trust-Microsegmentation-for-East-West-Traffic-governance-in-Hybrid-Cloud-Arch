Title: Policy-Oriented Zero Trust Microsegmentation for East-West Traffic Governance in Hybrid Cloud Architecture
Abstract: As hybrid cloud adoption accelerates, securing east-west traffic—communications between internal services have become a top priority. Traditional perimeter-based security models are insufficient in preventing lateral movement of threats across cloud environments. This paper presents a policy-oriented Zero Trust microsegmentation framework designed to govern east-west traffic with fine-grained control in hybrid cloud architectures. The proposed solution integrates Zero Trust principles with dynamic, policy-driven microsegmentation, leveraging software-defined networking (SDN) and identity-aware access control. Policies are enforced using Open Policy Agent (OPA) and service mesh technologies like Istio, which apply continuous verification of workload identity and context-aware rules. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we deployed it in a simulated hybrid cloud environment with microservices across private and public cloud nodes. The results show that our approach reduced the lateral attack surface by 78%, decreased policy enforcement latency by 35%, and contained unauthorized service access attempts with 92% effectiveness, compared to traditional VLAN or static segmentation models. These findings demonstrate that a policy oriented Zero Trust microsegmentation approach not only enhances visibility and control over internal traffic but also significantly improves the security posture and resilience of hybrid cloud environments
